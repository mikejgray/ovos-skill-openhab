    "description": "This skill adds [openHAB](http://www.openhab.org/) support to [OVOS](https://openvoiceos.org). The skill takes advantage of the openHAB REST API, so it works both with the v1.x and v2.x of openHAB. In order to make openHAB Items accessible to OVOS/Neon, they need to be [tagged](https://www.openhab.org/addons/integrations/homekit/). Device names recognized by OVOS/Neon are matched against openHAB Item Labels. The above examples would all work with the following set of openHAB Item definitons: ```java Color DiningroomLight \"Diningroom Light\" <light> (gKitchen) [ \"Lighting\" ] {channel=\"hue:0200:1:bloom1:color\"} Color KitchenLight \"Kitchen Light\" <light> (gKitchen) [ \"Lighting\" ] {channel=\"hue:0200:1:bloom1:color\"} Switch GoodNight \"Good Night\"\t[ \"Switchable\" ] Number MqttID1Temperature \"Bedroom Temperature\" <temperature> [ \"CurrentTemperature\" ] {mqtt=\"<[mosquitto:mysensors/SI/1/1/1/0/0:state:default]\"} Number MqttID1Humidity \"Bedroom Humidity\" [ \"CurrentHumidity\" ] {mqtt=\"<[mosquitto:mysensors/SI/1/0/1/0/1:state:default]\"} Group gThermostat \"Main Thermostat\" [ \"gMainThermostat\" ] Number MainThermostatCurrentTemp \"Main Thermostat Current Temperature\" (gMainThermostat) [ \"CurrentTemperature\" ] Number MainThermostatTargetTemperature \"Main Thermostat Target Temperature\" (gMainThermostat) [ \"TargetTemperature\" ] String MainThermostatHeatingCoolingMode \"Main Thermostat Heating/Cooling Mode\" (gMainThermostat) [ \"homekit:HeatingCoolingMode\" ] ``` If items are modified in openHAB, a refresh in OVOS/Neon is needed by the command: - *\"Hey Mycroft/Neon, refresh openhab items\"* If you've forgotten what items have been identified, you can ask OVOS/Neon: - *\"Hey Mycroft/Neon, list openhab items\"*",

    "versions change log": "* 2.0 refactor/modernization to support OVOS and Neon (provided AS-IS, no guarantee it works, I have no way of testing and the code hadn't been touched in 4 years. Here be dragons) * 1.5 addedd support to core v19 * 1.4 added spanish translation * 1.3 added german translation * 1.2 addedd python 3 support * 1.1 added status request to Switchable items * 1.0 added support to item tagged as Thermostat, CurrentTemperature, CurrentHumidity * 0.9 added dimming command to item tagged as Lighting * 0.8 supports only Lighting and Switchable tags, commands ON and OFF",
    "installation": "In OVOS and Neon, skill installation occurs via pip. To install the openHAB skill, run the following command: ```bash pip install git+https://github.com/mikejgray/ovos-skill-openhab ``` In Neon, skill installation must happen in `~/.config/neon/neon.yaml` to persist: ```yaml skills:   default_skills:     - git+https://github.com/mikejgray/ovos-skill-openhab ``` If `skills.default_skills` doesn't exist, add it. If it does, you only need to add the last line. After installation, the skill needs to be configured. In Neon, the path is `~/.config/neon/skills/ovos-skill-openhab.mikejgray/settings.json`. In OVOS, it is `~/.config/mycroft/skills/ovos-skill-openhab.mikejgray/settings.json`: ```json {     \"host\": \"192.168.1.42\",     \"port\": 8080 } ``` Replace the host IP and port with your openHAB server's IP and port. The default port is 8080."
